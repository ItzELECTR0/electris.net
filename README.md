# [ELECTRIS.net](https://electris.net)
#### The official in-house built website for ELECTRIS.<br> Built from the ground up by our own members.

## How to set up dev?

    git clone https://github.com/ItzELECTR0/electris.net.git
#### Then navigate into the directory
    cd electris.net
#### Lastly, install dependencies and run the development environment

## About the "WEBSITE UNDER RESTRUCTURE"
#### Simply because it didn't align with the [Creator Standard](https://electris.net/about/creator-standard), the website is getting an overhaul.<br> The preparations have been set, and from now no new commits will be pushed until it is finished.

## Submitting Improvements

#### Pull requests are welcome and encouraged.<br> If additions are nice and fit the [Creator Standard](https://electris.net/about/creator-standard), they will be merged and you will be credited as an official developer on the website
