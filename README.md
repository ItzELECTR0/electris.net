# [ELECTRIS.net](https://electris.net)
#### The official website for the ELECTRIS Project.<br>Built with Svelte and Typescript.

## Subdomains:

### For the Public

#### [testing.electris.net](https://testing.electris.net) (will be replaced by canary.electris.net)
##### The early-access version of the site.<br>I more often push here before main to make sure everything is fine.

### Everything else

#### [jellyfin.electris.net](https://jellyfin.electris.net)
##### Only exists so I can remotely connect.<br>It's my self-hosted media server.

#### [searxng.electris.net](https://searxng.electris.net)
##### Only exists so I can remotely connect.<br>My self-hosted instance of the SearXNG search engine.<br>You can use it if you want, just don't abuse it or I'll take it down.

## How to set up dev environment?

#### First, clone the project
    git clone https://github.com/ItzELECTR0/electris.net.git
#### Then navigate into the directory
    cd electris.net
#### Lastly, install dependencies and run the development environment
    npm install && npm run dev
#### If everything went right, you will see an address in the terminal console to access the page.<br>You will also see "development" in the sidebar footer.

## About the "WEBSITE UNDER RESTRUCTURE"
#### Simply because it didn't align with the [Creator Standard](https://electris.net/about/creator-standard), the website is getting an overhaul.<br> The preparations have been set, and from now no new commits will be pushed until it is finished.

## Submitting Improvements

#### Pull requests are welcome and encouraged.<br> If additions are nice and fit the [Creator Standard](https://electris.net/about/creator-standard), they will be merged and you will be credited as an official developer on the website
