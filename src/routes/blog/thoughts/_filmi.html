<div class="blog">
  <h2 class="title">I'd like to dedicate the first thought on this site, to my best friend.</h2>

  <p>Varrow is the co-founder of the ELECTRIS Project as well as the person I trust the most. <br> What I'm about to tell you is about an idea he once had that unfortunately never came to be.</p>

  <p>You see, Varrow wanted to create a streaming platform for indie content. A place fair to indie creators and film makers alike, dedicated to their work and compensating them for it far better than YouTube, with a user experience as great as on Netflix.</p>

  <p>As if Netflix and YouTube had a baby, so to speak. <br> But it was far greater than just that.</p>

  <p>He even wanted user-focused social features where people could have watch parties even with others without subscriptions.</p>

  <p>He had this idea a while back, and presented it to fans of such content, creators and even potential investors.</p>

  <p>He was shot down. Nobody liked the idea of his platform, well, nobody but me. <br> <span class="cinematic-text">I loved his idea.</span> </p>

  <p> As I've recently starting making short films myself, I love the idea even more. <br> Unfortunately, he was in no shape to try to bring it to life after what he's been told.</p>

  <p>I was certainly upset when he told me he was shutting down it's production, and maybe I didn't react in the best way at the time, but at heart, all I wanted was this project to exist. I'll say it again, I loved the idea. I love the idea. I want to see it one day. I don't know if anyone shares the same opinion as me, but I wanted to write this to show my buddy that at least someone believes in his idea, and that maybe he should give it another shot.</p>
